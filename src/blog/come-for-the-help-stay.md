## Come for the help, stay for the rewilding

### Wait, stop right there!

Before we go any further, this is **so 90's**. I've been re-reading an old <a href="https://www.davidcarsondesign.com/" target="_blank" data-tooltip="The most influential designer of the 90's and by my reckoning soon to be again as we react allergically to AI." class="popout tooltip">David Carson</a> book of mine recently. **Carson says some important things about intuition**, professionally, that I will explore in future posts.

Experiencing that book, and Carson's work again, inspired me to algorithmically create Carson-like experiences online. So that's what you're seeing in its early stages here with *"So 90's"*. You can turn off or play with So 90's up ^ there 🙂.

### Back to business...

Welcome to my new corner on the web, thanks for dropping in. 

Yes, I'm here and you're here to [see where I can help professionally](/#services). I do do [extraordinary ordinary work](/work) and you'll have noticed that this is also a bit of an off-kilter experience.

I'm one of those **OG web creators** who emerged as the web was invented by the glorious Sir Tim Berners-Lee. <a href="https://thisisforeveryone.timbl.com/" target="_blank" data-tooltip="Easy-to-read memoir of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web. What he has to say about the state of the web and his vision should be taken on board by anyone who cares about positive human flourishing." class="popout tooltip">Read his book!</a>

#### In love with the human spirit

For a quite while now I've lamented how the **very human ingenuity** in web design, graphic design, and even interior design has been pushed down by **social media and SEO algorithms, and now AI producing efficiency and homogenisation**.

We're also losing our resiliency and our soveriegnty online. It's nothing new to say we've become dependent on bigtech platforms, often compulsively even *resentfully* so. 

So while I'm **helping you professionally** in an extraordinary ordinary way, I'll also be pursuing a <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/we-need-to-rewild-the-internet/" target="_blank" data-tooltip="Our online spaces are not ecosystems, though tech firms love that word. They’re plantations..." class="popout tooltip">rewilding of the internet</a>, definitely personally, but all going well as a commercial venture too.

### Thank God it's Monday

Thanks for wading down here to experience a little rewilding of the web.

Meanwhile, I'll see you out there for the extraordinary ordinary, [let's talk!](/work)
