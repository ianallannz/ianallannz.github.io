## On trying to steer clear of social media

<img src="../../images/blog-election-bookmark.jpg" class="float-lg">During the recent local elections I distributed this bookmark instead of the usual flyer. I didn't get elected so you could say it didn't work. However if any of you still have one and **put it in a book, it did work**.

With social media, I'm not holier-than-thou or judging those that are getting utility from it, especially for supporting their businesses. 

But for me we've reached the point where, on-balance, the negatives of social media far outweigh its utility. 

The damage is visible everywhere, now proven by whistleblowers from inside these very companies. 

It's not just the severe division and rage it's fomenting, and the depression and anxiety and loneliness, but it's **the opportunity cost of all this needless distraction**. 

This video pitch for Pockit from four years ago is *still resonating*:

I'll see you out there in the meatspace, face to face.
