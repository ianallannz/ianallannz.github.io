## Design and development notes

This site is being developed using the 11ty framework, something I've become super fond of.

This site is my place to continue experiments with static site generation, re-wilding the web, and algorithmic layouts, decoration, and type-setting.

Fonts used:
- Space Grotesk, Space Mono
- Zilla Slab
- Recursive

Images:
- My own

### To do for now

- Couple of accessibility warnings
- Some JS trying to run where it shouldn't
- Safari testing
