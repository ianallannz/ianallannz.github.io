## Design and development notes

This site is being developed using the 11ty framework, something I've become super fond of.

This site is my place to continue experiments with static site generation, re-wilding the web, and algorithmic layouts, decoration, and type-setting.

Fonts used (it's a lot!):
- Space Grotesk, Space Mono
- Zilla Slab
- Recursive
- Baskervville
- Public Sans

Images:
- My own

### To do for now
- carson.js v0.5
  - handle data-tooltips on links
  - handle #modal popups
  - inject special characters, maybe use very large in behind
  - inject an SVG line or two
  - support an additional collection of image artefacts that can be injected
- carson.js v1.0
  - standalone with settings to enable it to be applied to content within any element
