## Design and development notes

This site is being developed using the 11ty framework, something I've become super fond of.

This site is my place to continue experiments with static site generation, re-wilding the web, and algorithmic layouts, decoration, and type-setting.

Fonts used:
- Space Grotesk, Space Mono
- Zilla Slab
- Recursive

Images:
- My own

### To do for now

- Welcome blog post
- Carsonify v0.2
  - use fonts in use
  - 2rem right margin (or media query)
  - variation in bold colour
  - blinking links or similar
  - tilt on some text
- Carsonify v0.3
  - duplicate images with big overlap
    - or re-use a cropped part
  - inject special characters, maybe use very large in behind
  - inject an SVG line or two
  - an additional collection of image artefacts that can be injected
