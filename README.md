## Design and development notes

This site is being developed using the 11ty framework, something I've become super fond of.

This site is my place to continue experiments with static site generation, re-wilding the web, and algorithmic layouts, decoration, and type-setting.

Fonts used:
- Space Grotesk, Space Mono
- Zilla Slab
- Recursive

Images:
- My own

### To do for now

- Welcome blog post
- carson.js v0.3
  - re-use a cropped part of an img for random zoome placement
- carson.js v0.4
  - inject special characters, maybe use very large in behind
  - inject an SVG line or two
  - an additional collection of image artefacts that can be injected
