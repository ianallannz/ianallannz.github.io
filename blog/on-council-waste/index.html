            <article>
                <p class="post-date">19 September 2025</p>
                <h2 id="if-we-want-to-lighten-the-load-we-all-need-to-change" tabindex="-1">If we want to lighten the load we all need to change <a class="direct-link" href="#if-we-want-to-lighten-the-load-we-all-need-to-change">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="stop-wasting-all-our-money!" tabindex="-1">Stop wasting all our money! <a class="direct-link" href="#stop-wasting-all-our-money!">#</a></h3>
<p>During the recent local election I regularly heard variations of &quot;the council needs to stop wasting all our money&quot;. When asked for examples of that waste, it's:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Too many staff!&quot;</strong></li>
<li><strong>&quot;Bloody raised crossings!&quot;</strong>, and the</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Cost of compliance and consenting!&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before I go any further...</p>
<ul>
<li>don't let your power company off the hook,</li>
<li>your insurance company off the hook,</li>
<li>your banks off the hook,</li>
<li>your oil companies off the hook,</li>
<li>your supermarkets off the hook.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to some of them, the amount of things you get for your rates dollars isn't too bad!</p>
<h4 id="%22too-many-staff!%22" tabindex="-1">&quot;Too many staff!&quot; <a class="direct-link" href="#%22too-many-staff!%22">#</a></h4>
<p>There have been notable increases in staffing levels in the last three years. These increases were mostly to support the necessary post-Gabrielle recovery work, these workers haven't been sitting around wasting time.</p>
<p>Hopefully, it sounds like a business-as-usual state will return in the next year.</p>
<p>But at the same time, central government reforms around resource management and water will change, again, what councils need to do.</p>
<p>And we should expect another 1-in-a-100-year weather event in the next few years.</p>
<p>It's not wishful thinking to reduce staffing levels, but signs from central government and the weather gods indicate that it might be less a case of &quot;getting back to normal&quot; and more a case of &quot;this is our new normal&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="%22bloody-raised-crossings!%22" tabindex="-1">&quot;Bloody raised crossings!&quot; <a class="direct-link" href="#%22bloody-raised-crossings!%22">#</a></h4>
<p>Putting Grey St aside, which was funded by NZTA, managed by a trust, enabled by the council. The council's biggest expense here has been managing feedback from the public.</p>
<p>Focusing on the bloody raised crossings elsewhere... as public infrastructure, I don't view them as a waste of money. And I've spoken on this in the past:</p>
<div class="video-container">
    <iframe width="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mTUeBhCLL44?si=cZmAWLIj1ZEMagLU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>There will be inefficiencies in the way the work is procured and managed by large consultancies. Here, I would like to see increased in-house technical expertise and authority.</p>
<h4 id="%22the-cost-of-compliance-and-consenting!%22" tabindex="-1">&quot;The cost of compliance and consenting!&quot; <a class="direct-link" href="#%22the-cost-of-compliance-and-consenting!%22">#</a></h4>
<p>I want to believe there are gains we can make here. I've said elsewhere:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal is for our council to be a conscientious enabler, with an increased risk appetite, while ensuring negative externalities are not passed on to the public.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from what I'm hearing, all local councillors agree.</p>
<p>So why do the public feel like compliance and consenting is so onerous and costly?</p>
<p>There will be operational efficiencies, sure, there always is and always will be in every organisation, public or private.</p>
<p>It appears the big issue is the burden of responsibility that has built up for the council.</p>
<p><strong>It isn't a surprise that councils have become extremely risk-averse with:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the leaky building saga</li>
<li>upholding expected environmental quality standards</li>
<li>so-called &quot;no surprises&quot; policies popularised by the Key government and filtered through public institutions</li>
<li>a changing climate changing risks</li>
<li>the building code and regulatory capture by our major suppliers</li>
<li>deferring decisions to consultants</li>
<li>changes to health and safety legislation</li>
<li>public backlashes fueled by social media</li>
</ul>
<p>So risk aversion is not an easy thing to unravel. Central government looks to be making some helpful changes.</p>
<p>For us to help the council get there too, <strong>we all need to take some responsibility and ownership, and accept that when genuine mistakes happen it's generally OK</strong>. With that shift, we can appreciate that humans with some decision-making authority are working in our best interests.</p>
<p>We don't simply point the finger at each other, we work together, and we all continue to learn and improve.</p>
<p>Naive? Probably.</p>

<h4 id="what's-the-biggest-cost-to-council%3F" tabindex="-1">What's the biggest cost to council? <a class="direct-link" href="#what's-the-biggest-cost-to-council%3F">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>Roads, pipes, waste, and emergency clean-ups.</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../images/gdc-operational-expenditure.png" alt="GDC operational expenditure 2024"></p>
<p>Three ways to materially reduce the long-term rates burden come to mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have more ratepayers</li>
<li>Manage road and pipe usage more effectively and efficiently</li>
<li>Be more resourceful, self-sufficient, and resilient</li>
</ol>
<p>Not trying to be too hippy dippy, but we could:</p>
<ul>
<li>incentivise us to collect the water off our roofs;</li>
<li>seriously reduce, reuse, and repurpose; and</li>
<li>use mentally and physcially healthier means to get around when we can.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll throw my weight behind any and all councillors who think the same!</p>
